        <p>The HLA loci and alleles for which maps are available were included in the Solberg meta-analysis. Not every
            identified HLA locus or allele will be represented by a map, neither are maps available for alleles in the
            Solberg data compilation that were observed only in admixed and migrant populations. White dots on the maps
            represent indigenous populations included in the Solberg analysis.</p>
